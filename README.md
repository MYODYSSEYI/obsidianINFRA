# A little something about this project 

Hey there! 

Welcome to my **IT Wiki** — a personal project that started out as a way to take notes in class, while I was in training. Now it’s grown into something I hope can help others too. Whether you’re just getting started or already deep into the world of tech, I’ve tried to keep things simple and easy to follow. 

That said, there’s probably still a ton of mistakes hiding in here! So, if you spot something off or have a better way to do things, feel free to contribute. This is a work in progress, and I’m always learning too.

Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you find it useful!
